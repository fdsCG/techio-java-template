# Template Resources

[`markdown/welcome.md`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/markdown/welcome.md)  
What you are reading right here comes from this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to render text, medias and to inject programming exercises.


[`java-project`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/tree/master/java-project)  
A simple Java + Maven + JUnit project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to execute the programming exercise according to the project requirements. You can use the [official Docker registry]() or build your own image.


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/techio.yml)  
This file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s), it's mandatory and its path must not be changed.

# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal into your playground. Please refer to the [documentation]() to get an in-depth understanding of viewers integration.
