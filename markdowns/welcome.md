[`java-project`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/tree/master/java-project)  
A simple Java + Maven + JUnit project dedicated to run the programming exercise upper. A project relies on a Docker image to be run according to the project requirements. You can use the [official Docker registry]() or build your own image.


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/fdsCG/techio-java-template/blob/master/techio.yml)
